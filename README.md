# Intelligent Financial Document OCR Parser

This project is an AI-powered OCR system designed to extract underwriting-relevant financial dataâ€”such as monthly deposits, average daily balances, and merchant namesâ€”from unstructured or image-based bank statements. Built for real-world use in a Wall Street brokerage.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Extracts:
  - Monthly revenue (deposits)
  - Average daily balances
  - Number of days with negative balances
  - Business name (merchant/borrower)
- Works with scanned PDFs or image files (JPG/PNG)
- Uses NLP + OCR + rule-based error correction

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`)
- `pdf2image`
- `spaCy` (for entity parsing)
- `Streamlit` (optional UI)
- `pandas`, `re`, `numpy`

## ðŸ“ˆ Real-World Impact

> Deployed in an active Wall Street brokerage firm  
> Boosted underwriting throughput by 53%  
> Reduced manual review time across over 1,000 statements/month
